# Adding a New MCU Port to dmspi

`dmspi_port` currently supports `stm32f7`. The port is split from
the core `dmspi` module so a new architecture can be added without
touching architecture-independent logic.

## Steps to add another architecture

1. Create `src/port/<family>/config.cmake`, setting `DMOD_TOOLS_NAME` for the
   target architecture (see `src/port/stm32f7/config.cmake` for the pattern -
   it must match a directory under `dmod/configs/arch/...`).
2. Create `src/port/<family>/port.c` implementing the
   `dmod_dmspi_port_api_declaration(...)` functions declared in
   `include/dmspi_port.h`, plus `dmod_init`/`dmod_deinit` and any
   `DMOD_IRQ_HANDLER(...)` needed.
3. If the underlying peripheral IP is identical across families, factor the
   shared logic into `src/port/<family>_common/` and keep each
   `src/port/<family>/port.c` a thin wrapper (lifecycle + IRQ only) - see
   `dmfmc/src/port/stm32_common/` for a real example of this split.
4. Build by selecting the new family:
   `cmake .. -DDMOD_CPU_FAMILY=<family>`.
5. Do not introduce a module-specific variable (e.g. `<MODULE>_MCU_SERIES`) for
   this - `DMOD_CPU_FAMILY` is the ecosystem-wide convention, already wired
   into `dmf-get` package resolution.
